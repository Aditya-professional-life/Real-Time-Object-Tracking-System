# Real-Time Object Tracking System

This project implements a real-time object tracking system using Python and OpenCV. It enables efficient monitoring and surveillance in video streams, utilizing background subtraction, contour detection, and the Euclidean distance-based tracking algorithm.

## Features

- Real-time object detection and tracking
- Background subtraction for foreground object extraction
- Contour detection for object localization
- Euclidean distance-based tracking algorithm for object tracking

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
[git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-object-tracking.git](https://github.com/Aditya-professional-life/Real-Time-Object-Tracking-System.git)
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

2. Provide the path to the video file when prompted.
